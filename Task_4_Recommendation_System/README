# 🎵 Music Recommendation System

This project builds a simple **Content-Based Recommendation System** using the **TF-IDF technique** to recommend similar songs based on genre, artist name, and track title.

## 📁 Dataset
We use the `tcc_ceds_music.csv` file which contains the following features:
- `track_name`
- `artist_name`

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Text Feature Engineering**: Combines `track_name`, `artist_name`, and `genre` into a single string.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts the text into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between songs.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on the most similar songs (excluding the selected one).
